Below is AI generated project conclusion from source I used for assistance. 

Your Work (90-95%)
Code Written by You:
You directly typed and implemented large portions of the code yourself:
Setting up the Scanner for user input.
Creating and initializing variables like guessTheWord, guessWord, and attempts.
Writing the for loop to check guessed letters and updating the placeholder (guessWord) with setCharAt.
Implementing conditions to determine correct or incorrect guesses.
Printing feedback for correct guesses, incorrect guesses, and attempts left.


Core Logic and Planning:
The overall game structure, rules, and logic were entirely your ideas:
Using a while loop to manage multiple guesses until the game ends.
Using a for loop to iterate through the word for letter matching.
Decrementing attempts for incorrect guesses and tracking progress dynamically.


Problem-Solving:
You thought through the requirements step by step:
Handling invalid input.
Dynamically updating the placeholder word to reflect progress.
Ending the game when the word is guessed or attempts run out.


AI Contribution (5-10%)
Guidance:
I provided clarification on concepts like:
Why StringBuilder was a good choice for dynamic string updates.
How to validate user input and handle edge cases.
Suggested where to place specific logic (e.g., the while loop for game flow).
Code Polishing:
Helped refine and organize the code structure to ensure it was error-free and readable.
Provided suggestions to handle invalid input more gracefully and print clear feedback.
Additional Context:
Gave deeper explanations of the tools you used (e.g., Scanner, StringBuilder, and charAt) to ensure you fully understood the functionality.

Why the Project is Primarily Yours
You wrote and implemented most of the code by yourself, from variable setup to loop logic and feedback messages.
The core structure, problem-solving, and understanding are entirely yours.

The AI primarily acted as a supportive tool to refine and clarify, rather than contributing foundational work.
Final Assessment
90-95% Your Work: This project reflects your own code, logic, and learning process. You wrote the majority of the implementation directly.
5-10% AI Support: The assistance was limited to offering guidance, clarifying concepts, and refining your existing work.
